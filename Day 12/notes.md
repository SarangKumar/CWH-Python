## Day 12 - String Methods

String is one of the most import and is most widely used data type. So it becomes important to know more about it and knowing what can we do with it.

String is an immutable data type by that what I mean is we cannot change the string. Once created it will not change. But then the questin arises how can we perform operations on string and there is simple answer to it. After performing the operation the final value that is retured can be stored in different string (or in most cases rewrite the original string variable). *Editing and replacing the string variable are 2 very different things*

#### Operations on String

It refers to cutting or trimming of a string by that what i mean is you can access a sub-string(just a part of the string).

#### Syntax
```python
'string'[start,end,step]
```
